Sandbox for learning different machine learning algorythms using the ruby language primarily. Sometimes I may dive into other langages as well.

Basic Example
-Predicts health status based on temperature using the decision tree ID3 method


Intermediate Example
-Predicts if the person is likely to purchase and become a customer based on the training data. 0 = Not likely and 1 = Likely
